# UNet-CHAC
UNet-CHAC is an innovative hybrid approach that seamlessly integrates deep learning and computer vision algorithms. This new technique enables automatic detection and precise measurement of grain size with good accuracy.

# Data Description
The example project for automatic detection and measurement of UO2 grain size consists of three folders: "images", "annotations", and "test". These folders encompass all the relevant images used in the project. To utilize them, kindly download the folders and consolidate them within a designated folder named "BF_TEM_Dataset". Once completed, you can proceed to the UNet module without any interruption.
