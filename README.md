# UNet-CHAC
UNet-CHAC is an innovative hybrid approach that seamlessly integrates deep learning and computer vision algorithms. This new technique enables automatic detection and precise measurement of grain size with good accuracy.

# Data Description
The example project for automatic detection and measurement of UO2 grain size consists of three folders: "images", "annotations", and "test". These folders encompass all the relevant images used in the project. To utilize them, kindly download the folders and consolidate them within a designated folder named "BF_TEM_Dataset". Once completed, you can proceed to the UNet module without any interruption.

# Code Description
The comprehensive UNet-CHAC method comprises three code modules: UNet, CHAC, and post-processing (utilizing the watershed algorithm for statistical output). Within each module, we have included extensive comments for every command line. These comments are intended to be beneficial for individuals familiar with Python, OpenCV, NumPy, Jupyter Notebook, and Google Colab, as they enable quick utilization of the provided code. Additionally, the "User manual" contains a list of other important considerations. If you encounter any issues not covered in the comments, please refer to the manual for further guidance.
